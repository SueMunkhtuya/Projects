    "### Sentiment Analysis Model\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "The sentiment analysis model employs a logistic regression classifier trained on a TF-IDF representation of the IMDB movie review dataset. Its main objective is to accurately classify movie reviews as either positive (1) or negative (0) based on their textual content. I assessed the model's performance using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Performance\n",
    "The model attained an accuracy of 80.2%, demonstrating a high level of correctness in predictions across the test dataset. It achieved a precision of 74.7%, indicating that it was correct about three-quarters of the time when it predicted a review as positive. The recall was notably higher at 90.7%, showing that the model was very effective at identifying actual positive reviews, although this might suggest a bias toward predicting positives. The F1 score, standing at 81.9%, highlights a robust overall performance, particularly in handling the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Issues\n",
    "I faced several challenges during model development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Dimension Mismatch**: Initially, there was a mismatch in feature dimensions between the training and testing datasets, caused by some tokens in the test set not being present in the training vocabulary. To mitigate this, I adjusted the feature extraction process to strictly use the vocabulary established during training, excluding any unseen tokens in the test set. While this method ensures consistency in feature representation, it might restrict the model’s ability to generalize to new, unseen words or phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text Processing Methodology**: Originally as provided from professor, code structure was to simply split on spaces and examined individually, which failed to preserve the original order of words in sentences. I changed this approach to utilize regular expressions that retain punctuation, aiding in maintaining more of the sentence structure during processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration of 'negword_dict'**: I planned to use 'negword_dict' in the 'neg_modifier' function to address negations based on detected negative words. However, the complexity involved in transforming the dictionary output into a format suitable for text modification proved too challenging. Instead, I chose for a simpler solution using a static list of negative words 'neg_words'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "The logistic regression model yielded quite promising results in the classification of the sentiment of movie reviews. All the problems related to feature mismatch and text processing that were being faced were catered to by changing the methodology in such a way that the model could be trained and tested in a consistent feature space. The approach toward handling negations was simplified, but it certainly yielded a pragmatic solution for the current scope of the project."
